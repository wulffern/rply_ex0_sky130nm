# Why
I wanted to create a step by step "tutorial" for 
the flow. Both to debug the tech setup, and to make it easier
for you to learn the tools. I use a simple current mirror as
the example.

Head over to [https://wulffern.github.io/rply_ex0_sky130nm/](https://wulffern.github.io/rply_ex0_sky130nm/) 
for the tutorial.

# Changelog

I've tagged the repo at each stage. That means you can 
checkout the 0.1.0 tag and do things yourself.

To checkout a specific stage, do 

``` bash
git checkout 0.1.0
```
