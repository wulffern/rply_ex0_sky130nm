title: Open source analog integrated circuit flow on Skywater 130nm
permalink: tutorial
categories: AIC
---

Getting started with analog integrated circuit design is hard. For most
technologies (28 nm TSMC, Globalfoundries 65 nm) you need to sign an
Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA), and as a private person, I'm not sure it's possible.
As such, the fact that there is now an open source technology
[sky130nm](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/) is fantastic.

> If you find errors/bugs in this "tutorial", then fork, fix, and send me a PR.

# Tools <a name="tools"></a>

## Assumed knowledge

I really hope that you're comfortable in the terminal and working with files/directories. If you've never used the terminal before, then you neeed to learn that first before you continue. Google "getting started with terminal".

## Operating system

I wrote this tutorial on MacOS, and it should translate to linux.

Windows is a different story. I would strongly recommend you install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net) to get the GUI.

On Windows 11 I think WSL includes a GUI, but I have not tried that.

You need to get comfortable in a [unix based system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) if you plan to have a career in integrated circuit design.

## Make project folder

Navigate to a place where you will store your files. I have the following setup.

```bash
$HOME/pro  # Automatically synced to my one-drive
$HOME/lpro # Where I store all my own git repos that I know I can loose
```

For example:
```bash
mkdir lpro
cd lpro
mkdir rply_ex0
cd rply_ex0
```

For the rest of the tutorial, I'll assume you'll use `lpro/rply_ex0` as the project folder.

## Open source tools

We first ran this tutorial in the spring of 2023. If you check the 1.0.1 tag
, you'll find the post from that time. 

The main thing we learned was, in theory, a docker image is a fast way
to start, in practice, it was not. Lot's of issues with Windows 11, X-server
etc.

I would recommend you install all tools locally. 
Follow the description at [Getting Started](https://analogicus.com/aicex/started/)


## Make cicconf config file

Open a new file called `config.yaml` in your favorite
text editor, and add it to the `rply_ex0` directory.

```yaml
options:
  template:
    ip: tech_sky130B/cicconf/ip_template.yaml
  project: rply
  technology: sky130nm
cpdk:
  remote: git@github.com:wulffern/cpdk.git
  revision: 0.1.1
tech_sky130B:
  remote: git@github.com:wulffern/tech_sky130B.git
  revision: 0.1.0

```
Get the tech library, and necessary files.

In rply_ex0:
```bash
cicconf clone --https
```

---

# Make IP files<a name="files"></a>

## Initialize new IP
The technology library includes a template to generate
IPs (make directories, make a xschem view etc). Have
a look inside `tech_sky130B/cicconf/ip_template.yaml` to
see what it does.

In rply_ex0:
``` bash
cicconf newip ex0
```

## Add remote repository
You don't have to add a remote, but it's a nice way to collaborate with others.

There are at least two options. You need to decide what you want to do.

### Use my remote
If you want to skip parts of this tutorial, for example, you already know how to draw schematics in Xschem, you can connect to my remote. My repository contains the files at different stages during this tutorial, and enables you to skip parts.

``` bash
cd rply_ex0_sky130nm
git branch local
git remote add origin \
 https://github.com/wulffern/rply_ex0_sky130nm.git
git pull
```

With my remote you can for example fast forward to tags. You can see the tags below.

| Tag | Status | Comment|
| :-| :-| :-|
|0.0.0 | :white_check_mark: | Make files and directories |
|0.1.0 | :white_check_mark: | Fix readme |
|0.2.0 | :white_check_mark: | Made schematic |
|0.3.0 | :white_check_mark: | Typical simulation |
|0.4.0 | :white_check_mark: | Corner simulation |
|0.5.0 | :white_check_mark: | Made layout |
|0.6.0 | :white_check_mark: | DRC/LVS clean|
|0.7.0 | :white_check_mark: | Extracted parasitics|
|0.8.0 | :white_check_mark: | Simulated parasitics |
|0.9.0 | :white_check_mark: | Updated README with simulation results|
|1.0.0 | :white_check_mark: | All done|

For example, checkout the initial tag:
```bash
git checkout 0.1.0
ls -1RG
```

Or checkout the final design:
```bash
git checkout 1.0.0
ls -1RG
```

You can see the number of files are very different.

Checkout the local tag before you proceed.

```bash
git checkout local
```

Since you have a new repository, it does not have the same history as mine,
so lets fix that with a rebase
```bash
git rebase 0.0.0
```

### Use your own remote
Create a repository with the same name on your choosen git vendor (for example [github](https://github.com))

``` bash
cd rply_ex0_sky130nm
git remote add origin \
 git@github.com:<your user name>/rply_ex0_sky130nm.git
```

## Edit README.md

Open README.md in your favorite text editor and make necessary changes.


## Familiarize yourself with the Makefile and make

I write all commands I do into a Makefile. There is nothing special with a Makefile, it's just what I choose
to use 20 years ago. I'm not sure I'd choose something different now.

``` bash
cd work
make
```

Take a look inside the file called Makefile.

# Current mirror <a name="cmirr"></a>

The block we'll make is a current mirror with a 1 to 5 scaling. The design files
will be

# Draw Schematic <a name="sch"></a>

A schematic is how we describe the connectivity, and the types of devices in an
analog circuit. The open source schematic editor we will use is XSchem.

> Fun fact: The schematic files are text files, open the one called *.sch in
> your favorite text editor and have a look.

All commands (except simulation commands) must be started from work/

In the work/ folder there are startup files for Xschem (xschemrc) and Magic (.magicrc).
They tell the tools where to find the process design kit, symbols, etc. At some point you probably
need to learn those also, but I'd wait until you feel a bit more comfortable.

Open the schematic:

```bash
xschem -b ../design/RPLY_EX0_SKY130NM/RPLY_EX0.sch &
```

## Add Ports

Add IBPS\_4U and IBPS\_20U ports, the P and N in the name signifies what
transistor the current comes from. So IBPS must go into a diode connected NMOS,
and N will be our output, and go into a diode connected PMOS somewhere else.

## Add transistors

Use 'Shift-I' to open the library manager. Use the "sky130B/libs.tech/xschem"
path. Open the "sky130_fd_pr" library. Find nfet_01v8.sym and place in your
schematic.

Select the transistor by clicking on it, press 'q' to bring up the properties.
Set L=0.36, W=3.6, nf=2 and press OK.

Select the transistor and press 'c' to copy it, while dragging, press 'shift-f'
to flip the transistor so our current mirror looks nice. 'shift-r' rotates the
transistor, but we don't want that now.

Press ESC to deselect everything

Select ports, and use 'm' to move the ports close to the transistors.

Press 'w' to route wires.

Use 'shift-z' and z, to zoom in and out

Use 'f' to zoom full screen

Remember to save the schematic

![](/rply_ex0_sky130nm/assets/RPLY_EX0.png)


## Netlist schematic

Check that the netlist looks OK

In work/
``` bash
make xsch
cat xsch/RPLY_EX0.spice
```

# Typical corner SPICE simulation <a name="simschtyp"></a>

I've made [cicsim](https://github.com/wulffern/cicsim) that I use to run simulations (ngspice) and extract
results

## Setup simulation environment
Navigate to the rply_ex0_sky130nm/sim/ directory.

Make a new simulation folder

``` bash
cicsim simcell  RPLY_EX0_SKY130NM \
 RPLY_EX0 ../tech/cicsim/simcell_template.yaml
```

I would recommend you have a look at simcell_template.yaml file to understand what happens.

## Familiarize yourself with the simulation folder

I've added quite a few options to cicsim, and it might be confusing. For
reference, these are what the files are used for

| File         | Description                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Makefile     | Simulation commands                               |
| cicsim.yaml  | Setup for cicsim                                  |
| summary.yaml | Generate a README with simulation results         |
| tran.meas    | Measurement to be done after simulation           |
| tran.py      | Optional python script to run for each simulation |
| tran.spi     | Transient testbench                               |
| tran.yaml    | What measurements to summarize                                                   |


The default setup should run, so

``` bash
cd RPLY_EX0
make typical
```

## Modify default testbench (tran.spi)

Delete the VDD source

Add a current source of 4uA, and a voltage source of 1V to IBNS_20U

``` spice
IBP 0 IBPS_4U dc 4u
V0  IBNS_20U 0 dc 1
```

Save the current in V0 by adding i(V0) to the save statement in the testbench

## Modify measurements (tran.meas)

Add measurement of the current and VGS. It must be added between the
"MEAS_START" and "MEAS_END" lines.

``` spice
let ibn = -i(v0)
meas tran ibns_20u find ibn at=5n
meas tran vgs_m1 find v(ibps_4u) at=5n
```

Run simulation

``` bash
make typical
```
 and check that the output looks okish.

Often, it's the measurement that I get wrong, so instead of rerunning simulation every time
I've added a "--no-run" option to cicsim. For example

``` bash
make typical OPT="--no-run"
```

will skip the
simulation, and rerun only the measurement. This is why you should split the testbench and the
measurement. Simulations can run for days, but measurement takes seconds.

You should notice that the current is not 20uA. We need to fix the schematic to make that happen.
Change the instance name of M2 to "M2[4:0]", and rerun typical simulation. Remember to save the schematic.

## Modify result specification (tran.yaml)

Add the result specifications, for example

``` yaml
ibn:
  src:
    - ibns_20u
  name: Output current
  min: -20%
  typ: 20
  max: 20%
  scale: 1e6
  digits: 3
  unit: uA

vgs:
  src:
    - vgs_m1
  name: Gate-Source voltage
  typ: 0.6
  min: 0.3
  max: 0.7
  scale: 1
  digits: 3
  unit: V
```

Re-run the measurement and result generation

``` bash
make typical OPT="--no-run"
```

Open [result/tran_Sch_typical.html]([https://github.com/wulffern/rply_ex0_sky130nm/sim/RPLY_EX0/result/tran_Sch_typical.html])


## Check waveforms

Start Ngspice

``` bash
ngspice
```

Load the results, and view the vgs

In ngspice
``` bash
load output_tran/tran_SchGtAttTtVt.raw
plot v(ibps_4u)
plot i(v0)
```

Based on the waveform we can see that maybe the voltage and current is not completely settled at 5 ns.

Change the measurement to occur at 9.5ns

---

# All corners SPICE simulations <a name="simschcorner"></a>

All commands should be run in sim/RPLY_EX0

Analog circuits must be simulated for all physical conditions, we call them corners.
We must check high and low temperature, high and low voltage, all process corners, and device-to-device mismatch.

For the current mirror we don't need to vary voltage, since we don't have a VDD.

## Remove Vh and Vl corners (Makefile)
Open Makefile in your favorite text editor.

Change all instances of "Vt,Vl,Vh" and "Vl,Vh" to Vt


## Run all corners
To simulate all corners do

``` bash
make typical etc mc
```

where etc is extreme test condition and mc is monte-carlo.

Wait for simulations to complete.

## Modify measurements to check settling

Let's say we want to check if the current has settled in our transient. We could extract the current at 9.0 ns
and check that it's roughly the same.

Add the following line to `tran.meas`

``` bash
meas tran ibns_20u_9n find ibn at=9n
```

And add the parameter to `tran.yaml`

``` yaml
ibn:
  src:
    - ibns_20u
    - ibns_20u_9n
```

Now, as you saw, the simulations take quite a while, so we don't want to rerun that.
Instead do

``` yaml
make typical etc mc OPT="--no-run"
```

## Get creative with python
If you're lazy, like me, then you don't want to spend time checking all the 9.5 ns numbers versus the
9 ns numbers. I'd much rather tell the computer how to do that.

It might be possible to do in ngspice, but sometimes a more complex tool is easier.

Open `tran.py` in your favorite editor, try to read and understand it.

The `name` parameter is the corner currently running, for example `tran_SchGtAmcttTtVt`.

The measured outputs from ngspice will be added to `tran_SchGtAmcttTtVt.yaml`

Delete the "return" line.

Add the following line

``` yaml
# Do something to parameters
obj["ibn_settl_err"] = \
  obj["ibns_20u"] - obj["ibns_20u_9n"]
```


Add the error to the result spec `tran.yaml`

``` yaml
err:
  src:
    - ibn_settl_err
  name: Current settling error
  typ: 0
  min: -2
  max: 2
  scale: 1e9
  digits: 3
  unit: nA

```

Re-run measurements to check the python code

``` yaml
make typical etc mc OPT="--no-run"
```

## Generate simulation summary

Run

``` bash
make summary
```

Install [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) if you don't have it

Run

``` bash
pandoc -s  -t slidy README.md -o README.html
```

to generate a HTML slideshow that you can open in browser. Open the HTML file.

## Think about the results

From the corner and mismatch simulation, we can observe a few things.

- The typical value is not 20 uA. This is likely because we have a M2 VDS of 1 V, which is not the same
  as the VDS of M1. As such, the current will not be the same.
- The statistics from 30 corners show that when we add or subtract 3 standard deviation from the mean,
  the resulting current is outside our specification of +- 20 %. I'll leave it up to you to fix it.

# Draw Layout <a name="layout"></a>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2iuqUWrDDaA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A foundry (the factory that makes integrated circuits) needs to know how we want
  them to create our circuit. So we need to provide them with a "layout", the
  recipe, or instruction, for how to make the circuit. Although the layout
  contains the same components as the schematic, the layout contains the
  physical locations, and how to actually instruct the foundry on how to make
  the transistors we want.

Open Magic VLSI

``` bash
magic &
```

Navigate to design directory

``` tcl
cd ../design
cd RPLY_EX0_SKY130NM
load RPLY_EX0.mag
```

Now brace yourself, Magic VLSI was created in the 1980's. For it's time it was extremely modern,
however, today it seems dated. However, it is free, so we use it.


## Magic VLSI

Try google for most questions, and there are youtube videos that give an intro.

- [Magic Tutorial 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORw5OaY33A4&t=9s)
- [Magic Tutorial 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUahmUtY814)
- [Magic Tutorial 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKWM1D0_fPI)
- [Magic command reference](http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/commandref/commands.html)

Default magic start with the BOX tool. Mouse left-click to select bottom corner,
left-click to select top corner.

Press "space" to select another tool (WIRING, NETLIST, PICK).

Type "macro help" in the command window to see all shortcuts

| Hotkey      | Function                          |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| v           | View all                          |

| Shift-Up    | Move cell up                      |
| Shift-Down  | Move cell down                    |
| Shift-Left  | Move cell left                    |
| Shift-Right | Moce cell right                   |

## Add transistors

In the Window menu, turn grid on, set grid 0.5 um and turn on snap-to grid.

Select "Devices 1 - NMOS". Match the parameters to schematic (W=3.6, L=0.36, fingers=2)

Unexpand, so it's possible to select the device (shift-x)

Place cursor over the device and select (s)

Move cursor to somewhere else, and copy (c), it will then snap to grid.

Select the old device, and delete (d).

Copy 4 more devices for M2.

## Add Ground

In the command window, type

``` tcl
see no *
see locali
see m1
```

Select a 0.5 um box below the transistors and paint the rectangle (middle click on locali)

Change grid to 0.1 um.

Connect guard rings to ground. Select a smaller box between guardring and the ground rectangle.

Select the rectangle, and copy to the other transistors

Connect the sources to ground.

![](/rply_ex0_sky130nm/assets/ground.png)

## Route Gates

All the gates are connected, so we can enter use the wire mode

```tcl
see no locali
```

It seems like the device generator adds too small m1 around the gate, so add a rectangle.

Press "space" to enter wire mode. Left click to start a wire, and right click to end the wire.

The drain of M1 transistor needs a connection to from gate to drain. We do that for the middle transistor.

![](/rply_ex0_sky130nm/assets/gates.png)

## Drain of M2

Select a box on the left most transistor drain. Paint m1.

Unexpand all, use the wire tool to draw connections for the drains.

To add vias you can do "shift-left" to move up a metal, and "shift-right" to go down.

![](/rply_ex0_sky130nm/assets/drains.png)

## Add labels

Select a box on a metal, and use "Edit->Text" to add labels for the ports.

# Layout verification <a name="ver"></a>

The DRC can be seen directly in Magic VLSI as you draw.

To check layout versus schematic navigate to work/ and do

``` tcl
make xsch xlvs
```

And you should see that it's incorrect. I forgot one transistor of the current mirror, M2 was 5 devices.

Add the fith transistor and try again. It should still be incorrect.

Turns out that the Xschem interpretation of width is different than in Magic VLSI.

In xschem "W=3.6, nf=2" means that the device is actually 3.6 um wide, but has two fingers.
In Magic "W=3.6, nf=2" means that the device is 7.2 um wide, and has fingers of 3.6 um.

The easiest way to fix it is to modify the schematic to match the layout.

Open the schematic, select M1, press q, and change "W=7.2". Do the same for M2.

Now the layout should match the schematic.

# Extract layout parasitics <a name="lpe"></a>

With the layout complete, we can extract parasitic capacitance.

``` bash
make lpe
```

Check the generated netlist

``` bash
cat lpe/RPLY_EX0_lpe.spi
```

---

# Simulate with layout parasitics <a name="simlpe"></a>

Navigate to sim/RPLY_EX0. We now want to simulate the layout.

The default `tran.spi` should already have support for that.

Open the Makefile, and change

```
VIEW=Sch
```

to

```
VIEW=Lay
```

## Typical simuation

Run

```bash
make typical
```

The simulation might not look right.

Open the `work/lpe/RPLY_EX0_lpe.spi` and `work/xsch/RPLY_EX0.spice` and have a look at the .subckt line.

For me, the ports were not the same order, which makes the simuation fail.

To fix it, open `design/RPLY_EX0_SKY130NM/RPLY_EX0.mag` in your favorite text editor.
Yes, the layout file is a text file!

Take a look towards the bottom, you'll see

```
flabel metal1 4460 ... IBPS_4U
port 1 nsew
flabel locali 4200 ... VSS
port 2 nsew
flabel metal2 4520 ... IBNS_20U
port 3 nsew
```

Change the numbers so we get the same port order as the schematic

```
flabel metal1 4460 ... IBPS_4U
port 2 nsew
flabel locali 4200 ... VSS
port 1 nsew
flabel metal2 4520 ... IBNS_20U
port 3 nsew
```

Open a new terminal, navigate to work/ and extract the parasitics again

``` bash
make lpe
```
Check the `work/lpe/RPLY_EX0_lpe.spi` again.

Run typical simulation.

Observer that now the difference between "ibps_20u" and "ibps_20u_9n" is a bit large.

Check the current waveform. Change the
transient simulation to run a bit longer, and extract a bit later.
19.5 ns seem to work.

## Corners
Navigate to sim/RPLY_EX0. Run all corners again

``` bash
make all
```

## Simulation summary

Open `summary.yaml` and add the layout files.

``` yaml
      - name: Lay_typ
        src: results/tran_Lay_typical
        method: typical
      - name: Lay_etc
        src: results/tran_Lay_etc
        method: minmax
      - name: Lay_3std
        src: results/tran_Lay_mc
        method: 3std
```

Open the README.md and have a look a the results.

You can also have a look at the [rendered page](/rply_ex0_sky130nm/rply_ex0_sim_all)

# Gotchas <a name="gotchas"></a>

- If you have not resimulated the schematic, then you're comparing apples to oranges since the schematic had W=3.6
- In the extracted layout the ad, as, etc looks funky, I don't understand why they are zero
- One of reasons the simulation is slow is that ngspice needs to load about 50 MB of spice files (the skywater models).
  They could run faster if we only loaded what is necessary, but that's a bit more work.
