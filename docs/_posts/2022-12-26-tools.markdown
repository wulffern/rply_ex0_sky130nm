In the course we will be using open source tools.

## Word of warning

If you're unfamiliar with linux, git, make, compiling, then I'm afraid just getting the tools installed will be a difficult thing for you. I have made a docker image that you can use which does make it easier (hopefully), but I would strongly encourage you to install everything locally. The tools run on both linux and MacOS. If you use windows, then install the tools in windows subsystem for linux, and use [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net) to connect linux server or to the local wsl installation.

The reason I want you to learn to install the tools is because they are continuously evolving, and you should know how to install future versions. In addition, all engineers should know the principles of installing tools. The more you know, the more indispensible you become for an employer, and it becomes easier to talk to people that know alot.

Now, if you don't want to listen to my advice, just skip to Cloning AICEX and try to use the docker


## Analog tools

|:---|:---|:---|:---|   
|open_pdks|	Install pdk|	[open_pdks](http://opencircuitdesign.com/open_pdks/)	|git clone https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks|
|ngspice	|Spice simulator	|[ngspice](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io)	|git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/ngspice/ngspice|
|magic	|Layout and DRC|	[magic](http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/)	|git clone https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/magic|

|netgen	|Layout versus Schematic|	[netgen](http://opencircuitdesign.com/netgen/)	|git clone https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/netgen.git|
|cicsim	|Python script to simplify IP creation and corner simuloation	|[cicsim](https://github.com/wulffern/cicsim)	|git clone https://github.com/wulffern/cicsim|

## Digital tools

|Tool	|What	|Website|	Source|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|  
|OpenLane	|Full synthesis, place and route, and timing closure for digital|	[openlane](https://openlane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)|	https://openlane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html|

## Option 0: Docker - with someone else than me maintaining
See [https://github.com/iic-jku/iic-osic-tools](https://github.com/iic-jku/iic-osic-tools) 

## Option 1: Docker - Maybe the simplest
See
[https://analogicus.com/aicex/started/](https://analogicus.com/aicex/started/)

## Option 2: Vagrant - for those struggling with Docker
See [https://github.com/wulffern/aicex/tree/main/vaicex](https://github.com/wulffern/aicex/tree/main/vaicex)

## Option 3:  Install the tools with my makefile

Clone [https://github.com/wulffern/aicex](https://github.com/wulffern/aicex)

On Ubuntu or Mac
```bash
cd aicex/tests/
make requirements
make tt
make eda_compile
sudo make eda_install
sudo python3 -m pip install matplotlib numpy click svgwrite pyyaml pandas tabulate wheel setuptools tikzplotlib
source install_open_pdk.sh
```

You need to add the following to your ~/.bashrc
```bash
export PDK_ROOT=/opt/pdk/share/pdk
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/eda/lib
export PATH=/opt/eda/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```


## Option 4: Install from source
You know what to do I assume
