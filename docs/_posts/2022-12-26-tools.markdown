In the course we will be using open source tools.

## Word of warning

If you're unfamiliar with linux, git, make, compiling, then I'm afraid just
getting the tools installed will be a difficult thing for you. 
The tools run on both linux and MacOS. If you use windows, then install the
tools in windows subsystem for linux, and use
[MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net) to connect linux server or to the
local wsl installation. On Windows 11, or the latest WSL with GUI, you don't need the MobaXterm.

The reason I want you to learn to install the tools is because they are
continuously evolving, and you should know how to install future versions.
In addition, all engineers should know the principles of installing tools. The more you know, the more indispensible you become for an employer, and it becomes easier to talk to people that know alot.

## Option 1: Install the tools via aicex

See [Getting Started](https://analogicus.com/aicex/started/)


## Option 2: Docker - with someone else than me maintaining
See [https://github.com/iic-jku/iic-osic-tools](https://github.com/iic-jku/iic-osic-tools) 


## Option 3: Install from source
You know what to do I assume
