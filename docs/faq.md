## How do I get an error in the tutorial fixed?

If you find an error in what I've made, or you figure out something that others can benefit from, then [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), fix, [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit), [push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) and [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request). That way, we use the global brain power most efficiently, and avoid multiple humans spending time on discovering the same error.

And you don't have to wait for me to remember I was going to fix something, and have time to fix something.
